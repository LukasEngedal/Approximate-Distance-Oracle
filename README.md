# Implementing and Investigating the Performance of an Approximate Distance Oracle for Planar Undirected Graphs
This repository is for the rapport as well as the full implementation created in connection with the bachelor thesis done at the University of Copenhagen in 2016 by me, Lukas Engedal.

The thesis is available in thesis.pdf.

The code is found in the "src" folder, and is just one big mess of .c and .h files. The code was not initially made public when I handed in the thesis, and so I never bothered to clean it up.

Most of the files are my implementations of various data types in C such as graphs, queues, heaps etc. that I needed, as well as implementations of some auxiliary algorithms such as Dijkstra's. Another set of files are for testing and benchmarking my implementations.

The main algorithm is implemented in thorup04.c.
